conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

- The view of the UV index shows a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

- The future weather conditions for that city shows a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

- The "on click" for a city in the search history will show current and future conditions for that city
